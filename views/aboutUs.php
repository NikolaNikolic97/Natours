        Why We Rock
    </h2>
    <p class="about_paragraph">
        Any company can boast that they know all the cool trails and sites, have experienced guides, have wilderness medical training, and a love of the outdoors. Well guess what? We all do! When you decide to go with Just Roughin' It, you are getting an extra bit of awesomeness that is unexplainable. Maybe because we are sought out by national and international media as experts in the field. Or maybe because we are all so good looking. Or maybe we are more than just an adventure tour company.  We are looking to give you the experience of a lifetime that requires a bit of extra hard work and a sense of adventure.  Life is just too short to see the world from a bus window, a motel room door, google maps or from the back of a Sherpa.
